EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Objective
To design a complete wedding planning app which could manage all the expenses made in a weeding. Suggest venues, budget options, ratings reviews for a weeding as per location of the user. Book almost everything required for all the events taking place in a weeding.  
Solution
We will build a mobile-based application and a web-based application which consists of a login screen with three options of a bride, bridegroom and vendor. After logging in with their respective credentials. If its a bridegroom he will be firstly prompted to add his budget and then the he will be suggested about various things he should buy, some of the most important things that should not be missed. After adding all this information , the budget calculator will calculate the budget and compare it with the budget provided buy the user. Further, if the user purchases any other item for his weeding different from the items mentioned at the starting of the app, the expense and the budget will get updated automatically. If a vendor registers on this app, he will be prompted to add his information about his products, its cost, and the amount of minimum time in which he can deliver at a specific pin code /region. A user can book a photographer dancer, singer on this app and check out their rates before booking them. Lastly, if a bride registers herself, she can add what all are the things she wishes to book on this app ranging from dress, jewellery, venue to almost anything. More than one user can login using the same account so that everyone in a family can add the expenses spent by them which will be updated to the total budget of the marriage.
